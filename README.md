# Rocketry_DTU
Rocketry-DTU is a student team devoted to designing, developing and testing model rockets from scratch. My time with the team helped me gain hands-on experience in the 
basic working of a flight control system and its integration (both software and hardware) with different sensors used in autonomous flight vehicles.

Intrigued by and thus exclusively involved in studying the IMU-9axis sensors (particularly BNO055 and MPU6050) to develop an inertial measurement unit(IMU). Got well 
acquainted with Arduino, python and its libraries especially Vpython, various sensor fusion algorithms and 3D spatial rotations(quaternions, Euler rotations, gimbal lock).

Devised a real time roll and pitch orientation sensor which is used to map the orientation of the model rocket during flight.
